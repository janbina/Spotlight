# Spotlight watch face for Garmin devices

This is a clone from the Android watch face [Spotlight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maize.spotlight) by Maize wich is an implementation of this original idea by [Konstantin Pulyarkin](http://hop-picker.tumblr.com/post/51065757240):

There are multiple implementations for this watch face for Android and Garmin but the Garmin version ([Zoomface](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/15d521ab-e562-4fde-a708-852102025a75)) that i found isn't compatible with the Garmin Venu.

I really wanted to have this watch face for my Venu so i tried to create it myself. At a certain moment i got stuck and then [docwilco](https://github.com/docwilco) basically took over :)

This is the result:
